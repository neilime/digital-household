# Make and workflow conventions

Follow the [workstation-manager Makefile](https://github.com/neilime/workstation-manager/blob/main/Makefile)
and [workflow layout](https://github.com/neilime/workstation-manager/tree/main/.github/workflows).
Use annotated targets for `make help` and a shared `run_linter` helper for
`make lint` and `make lint-fix`. The linter runs on Linux amd64 with the caller's
UID/GID and the checkout's absolute path as its workspace. A failed image build
stops the command before linting. The shared image respects `.gitignore`; keep
local caches and generated reports excluded there.

`make lint-fix` applies supported automatic fixes. `make lint docs/` limits
linting to matching paths. Positional filters apply only to lint commands;
unknown standalone targets fail. `make ci` runs local linting with fixes.
VM integration tests run in CI; see the
[validation guide](docs/usage/validation.md) for scenarios and reporting.

`main-ci.yml` and `pull-request-ci.yml` call `shared-ci.yml`. Main supports
pushes and manual runs; PR CI also supports merge queues. Both cancel superseded
runs for the same workflow and ref. Start workflows with `permissions: {}` and
grant only the permissions required by each job. Keep step names descriptive,
Actions pinned; compose shared VM operations in the job. The aggregate `checks`
job requires every prerequisite to succeed and is required by branch protection.

Use Conventional Commits and reviewed pull requests. Pin all three VM actions
to the same immutable revision in `shared-ci.yml`. Update those references
together when adopting a shared CI change, then require the hosted VM job to pass
before merging.

## Repository automation

Keep the five Hoverkraft maintenance workflows alongside the CI entrypoints:

- `greetings.yml` welcomes first-time contributors on new issues and PRs.
- `need-fix-to-issue.yml` turns fix markers into issues after main pushes, or
  for a manually selected commit range.
- `semantic-pull-request.yml` validates Conventional Commit PR titles.
- `renovate.yml` runs dependency updates weekly and on manual dispatch.
- `stale.yml` manages inactive issues and PRs daily using shared defaults.

The four collaboration workflows reuse pinned ci-github-common workflows.
Renovate uses the repository's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, scoped through job
permissions. No additional credential is required. Keep the repository
configuration in `.github/renovate.json`. Dependabot owns Actions and Docker
updates; Renovate handles Ansible and Terraform dependencies when their manifests
are present. The bootstrap has no such manifests yet. Schedules become active
after these workflows reach the default branch.

Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" under
Settings > Actions > General so Renovate can open PRs. GitHub couples creation
and approval in this setting; the workflows do not approve PRs or enable
automatic merges. Keep the required review and passing checks on main.
For a Renovate PR, select "Approve workflows to run" on the PR page to start
its pending CI runs, then review the results and changes before merging.
